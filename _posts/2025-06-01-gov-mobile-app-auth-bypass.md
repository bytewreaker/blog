# Authentication Bypass in Indian Government Mobile App

While exploring a government-issued Android mobile app meant for departmental users, I discovered a severe authentication vulnerability that allowed **unauthorized access without valid credentials**.

---

## 🔍 Overview

The app's login flow allowed users to enter a mobile number and request a One-Time Password (OTP). However, it turned out that entering a **hardcoded mobile number and OTP** would grant full access—without any real verification.

## 🧪 Steps to Reproduce

1. Open the mobile app (latest version).
2. Select the login type.
3. Enter mobile number: `0000000000`.
4. Click “Login with OTP”.
5. Enter OTP: `123456`.
6. You are logged in successfully — no real OTP validation occurs.
